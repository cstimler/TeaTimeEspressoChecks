# TeaTime Code

This is a exercise repository for the TeaTime example app which is part of Udacity's Advanced Android course. TeaTime is a mock tea ordering app that demonstrates various uses of the Espresso Testing framework (i.e. Views, AdapterViews, Intents, IdlingResources). 

Commit #2: This commit contains two simple espresso tests of the increment_button and the decrement_button, part of the OrderActivity.
